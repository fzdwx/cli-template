## Getting Started

## Features

### Modern Style

This template uses https://github.com/pterm/pterm to provide colorful, cross-platform compatible output by default!

### Automatic Releases

> Releasing new versions of your tools was never so easy!  

Our custom made CI system will detect when you change the version of your CLI and will **automatically create a GitHub release for you**.
You'll never have to deploy your CLI tools manually again! 


### Custom Libraries

We use libraries, which were specially made for this template, to give you the best user experience without a ton of code.
